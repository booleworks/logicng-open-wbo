# Open-WBO MaxSAT Solver

## LogicNG Fork

This fork is a modified version, designed to be included as library in
[logicng-rs](https://github.com/booleworks/logicng-rs).  

- We have simplified the program structure.
- Removed Code unused by LogicNG.
- Removed build process for CLI. (Only a build as library is possible).
- Improved build-scripts to support more platforms. 

## Version 2.1 - September 2018

Open-WBO is an extensible and modular open-source MaxSAT Solver.
Open-WBO was one of the best solvers in the partial MaxSAT categories at 
MaxSAT Evaluations 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and in the decision and 
optimization for SMALLINT categories at PB Evaluation 2016.

## MaxSAT Evaluation 2018
The default algorithms used by Open-WBO in the complete track are: 
* unweighted: Part-MSU3
* weighted: OLL
